<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<img width="700" alt="minishell_screenshot" src="https://github.com/ferri17/minishell/assets/19575860/82977658-8af7-4e6e-98bf-af69bb83e507">

**Minishell is a Unix shell** really similar to bash but with some reduced functionalities. The project is written from scratch in C.
Some of the features are:
- Displays current directory when waiting for a new command.
- Working history of commands.
- Searches and launches the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a
relative or an absolute path).
- Variable expansion of environment variables, tilde characater '~' and $?.
- Single and double quotes as bash would, single quotes prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence.
- Redirections:
	- '<' Redirects input.
	- '\>' Redirects output.
	- '\<<' + DELIMITER, reads the input until a line containing the
	delimiter is seen. It doesnâ€™t update the history.
	- '\>>' Redirects output in append mode.

- Works with pipes '|'. The output of each command in the pipeline is connected to the input of the next command via a pipe.
- $? is updated with the exit code of the last executed command in the pipe.
- Handles signals ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which behave like in bash.
